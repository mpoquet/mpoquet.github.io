Since 2022, I'm an associate professor (Maître de conférences) at `UT3`_ and member of the Sepia_ team at IRIT_ (Toulouse, France).

Formerly I was in the Datamove_ Inria_/LIG_ team (Grenoble France), where I worked as a postdoc/research engineer for the REGALE_ and IDIOM projects. That's also where I did my PhD, with Denis Trystram and Pierre-François Dutot.
I did a postdoc with Martin Quinson in Rennes on the emulation of distributed applications.
I discovered computer science research at Orléans thanks to Sébastien Limet and Sophie Robert.

​My work is mostly about distributed systems, especially high performance computing platforms.
I study resource management techniques to exploit these platforms at best,
and I am also interested in studying the applications that run on them.
Software development is a passion for me and I believe that software is now key for research and technologies.
I believe that knowledge should be shared, and most of my experiments and tools are open source.
Reproducibility of scientific experiments is important for me.
