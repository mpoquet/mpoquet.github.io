Big Data (2019)
---------------

I gave practical work sessions about Hadoop and Spark to ENSIMAG third-year students (≈ second-year master’s degree students).

Advanced algorithms (2017)
--------------------------

I worked on lessons about advanced algorithms to ENSIMAG second-year students
(≈ first-year master’s degree students). I was in charge of:

-  design of the practical work
-  evaluation of the students' work


Introduction to algorithms and programming (2015-2017)
------------------------------------------------------

I had the opportunity to teach introduction to algorithms and
programming to first-year science students.
This experience was great as each year I could follow a single group of
students (≈ 30 students) — as the only teacher of this subject for the
group.

-  design of lecture, exercises, practical work, IT project and exam
-  giving lecture, exercises and practical work
-  evaluation of the students’ work
